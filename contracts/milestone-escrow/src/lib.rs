    // ── dispute_arbitration_split: storage-optimised key design ────────────
    //
    // Design rationale
    // ─────────────────
    // A naïve split-state layout would persist a full `RefundAllocation`
    // (2×i128 + 2×u32) under Address-bearing keys such as
    // `(arbiter: Address, milestone_index: u32)`.  On Soroban each Address
    // contributes ~32 bytes to the ledger key footprint.
    //
    // This implementation uses three optimisations to minimise bytes stored:
    //
    // 1. **Key is only `u32`** (`ArbitrationSplitBps(milestone_index)`) —
    //    no Address payload in the key.
    //
    // 2. **Value is a single `u32` BPS** — freelancer BPS is derived as
    //    `BPS_SCALE - client_refund_bps`, so the second BPS field and both
    //    i128 payout amounts are never written to storage (amounts live in
    //    the persistent `Milestone` entry already required for settlement).
    //
    // 3. **Temporary storage tier** — the compact BPS signal is auto-evicted
    //    after the dispute workflow ends rather than accruing persistent rent.
    //
    // Deterministic access: the same milestone index always maps to the same
    // key; reads never require scanning Address-keyed maps.

    /// Allocate a disputed amount into client refund vs freelancer payout by BPS.
    ///
    /// Uses floor division for the client share and assigns the remainder to the
    /// freelancer so the two legs always sum exactly to `total_amount` (no value
    /// is lost to rounding).

    // ── multisig approval: storage-optimised key design ────────────────────
    //
    // Design rationale
    // ─────────────────
    // Traditional multisig implementations store approval state as individual
    // `(Address, ProposalId) → bool` entries, which is expensive on Soroban
    // because each Address contributes ~32 bytes to the ledger key footprint.
    //
    // This implementation uses three optimisations to minimise bytes stored:
    //
    // 1. **Signer set and threshold are stored once** (instance storage) in a
    //    single consolidated `MultiSigConfig` entry — rather than one key per
    //    signer, and rather than the two separate `MultiSigSigners` /
    //    `MultiSigThreshold` keys used before issue #456.
    //
    // 2. **Approval tracking uses a compact u32 bitmap** in temporary storage
    //    under `MultiSigApproval(proposal_id)`.  Each bit represents one signer
    //    by its index in the signers vec, eliminating the Address overhead from
    //    every approval entry.  Up to 32 signers are supported per proposal.
    //
    // 3. **Temporary storage tier** is used for the bitmap so that the ledger
    //    footprint is automatically evicted once the proposal lifecycle ends,
    //    rather than persisting indefinitely.
    //
    // Issue #457 audited the *write* path of `multisig_approve` against this
    // design and found the layout itself already minimal: the bitmap is one key
    // of key type `u32` holding one `u32`, there is no separate per-proposal
    // metadata key, and the signer set/threshold metadata is read from the
    // instance entry the call needs anyway (for `DataKey::Job`).  The one
    // remaining redundant storage access was the unconditional bitmap write,
    // which re-wrote an unchanged `u32` on every duplicate approval; it is now
    // skipped whenever the signer's bit is already set, so a duplicate approval
    // writes no contract storage key at all.  See `multisig_approve`.

    ///
    /// 1. **Authorization** — `require_admin_from_instance` performs
    ///    `admin.require_auth()` (so a transaction that omits the admin
    ///    signature is rejected by the host before the contract body executes)
    ///    and then compares against the stored admin.  Being first, an
    ///    unauthorized caller learns nothing about the lock: it cannot
    ///    distinguish “already locked” from “not configured” on an escrow it
    ///    is not allowed to administer.
    /// 2. **Illegal source state** — an absent `InterestYieldState` entry is
    ///    `NotInitialized`, and a configuration that is *already* locked is
    ///    `InvalidStatus`.  Re-locking is refused rather than silently
    ///    no-opping, so an operator (or an indexer replaying the call) can never
    ///    mistake a redundant call for one that took fresh action.  This mirrors
    ///    the guard `unlock_escrow_interest_yield` applies to unlocking an
    ///    unlocked configuration, and is why this endpoint cannot reuse
    ///    `ensure_interest_yield_writable` — that helper deliberately maps an
    ///    absent state to “writable” so the first configuration write can
    ///    create it, whereas `lock` has no create path.
    ///
    /// Because the guards are exhaustive, the only way to reach the write is with
    /// an authenticated admin and a configured-but-unlocked configuration; every
    /// rejection path returns above the write and therefore leaves the ledger
    /// unchanged.
    ///
    /// ## Storage-footprint note
    ///
    /// Like `set_escrow_interest_yield`, this function uses

// ── escrow_interest_yield: admin emergency override endpoints ─────────────────
//
// Design rationale
// ─────────────────
// In rare operational conditions (e.g. a client or freelancer becoming
// unresponsive, a key being compromised, or yield accounting needing manual
// correction) the platform admin must be able to resolve a locked escrow
// without depending on the normal multi-party workflow.  These endpoints are
// intentionally narrow in scope:
//
//   • Every function requires a fresh `admin.require_auth()` and then verifies
//     the supplied address against the persisted `DataKey::Admin` value, so no
//     other address — including the client, freelancer, or arbiter — can ever
//     invoke them.
//
//   • Overrides are not gated on milestone status; the admin can act on a
//     milestone in ANY state (Pending, Delivered, PartiallyReleased, Disputed,
//     etc.) so that genuinely stuck escrows can always be resolved.
//
//   • Every action emits a structured on-chain event so that off-chain
//     indexers, auditors, and the parties involved receive an immutable record
//     of what happened and who authorised it.

// Deferred pending coordinated migration to #[contractevent] — see
// escrow-backend's poller.ts, which reads the current event wire format.
#[allow(deprecated)]

// ── multisig_approval: admin emergency override & split-refund endpoints ────
//
// Design rationale
// ─────────────────
// In multi-signature escrow workflows, deadlocks can arise when one or more
// signers become unresponsive or keys are compromised.  These endpoints give
// the platform admin the ability to resolve locked multisig conditions
// unilaterally while emitting immutable on-chain events for auditability.
//
//   • Every admin function requires a fresh `admin.require_auth()` and then
//     verifies the supplied address against `DataKey::Admin`, so no other
//     address can invoke them.
//
//   • The `multisig_split_refund` helper implements refund distribution
//     pathways for split-refund claims, returning a `RefundAllocation`
//     struct that downstream code can use to execute proportional transfers
//     between client and freelancer.
//
//   • Every action emits a structured on-chain event so that off-chain
//     indexers, auditors, and the parties involved receive an immutable record.

// Deferred pending coordinated migration to #[contractevent] — see
// escrow-backend's poller.ts, which reads the current event wire format.
#[allow(deprecated)]

    ///    not have the contract compute it.
    /// 3. No pause transition may be half-applied (`EmergencyPauseInProgress`).

    ///    endpoint describes the split *while frozen*, so producing a figure
    ///    for a running escrow is an illegal source state.
    ///
    /// Authorization deliberately precedes the source-state guards so an
    /// unauthorized caller learns nothing about the escrow's pause status.
    ///
    /// # Validation order
    /// The total and the weight vector are fully validated *before* the first
    /// division by `Σweights` is attempted, so a malformed vector can never
    /// reach the arithmetic and can never trap:
